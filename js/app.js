//BASIC GAME:
//user presses big-buttons to generate big numbers
//user presses small-buttons to generate small numbers
//user presses go-button to generate answer at top of screen
//timer starts for 30 secs
//after 30secs is up dim clock image and display "times up".
//user presses solution button to give up 
//stop clock when solution displays on the left side of page.
//user presses reset to clear everything on page

//-------------------------------------------------------

//PSEUDO CODE:
//set out all variables for each all elements like the calculator


//user presses big-buttons to generate big numbers
//create buttons with click event listeners to make the buttons display html in div's
//get numbers from an array with big numbers [100, 75, 50, 25]

//user presses small-buttons to generate small numbers
//get numbers from an array with number (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10) 

//these number will go into new array called top-numbers (max length of array is 6).

//user presses go-button to generate answer (which will be displayed in answer-div).
//cannot press go-button without all the six top-numbers being filled.
//calculation of answer using random indexes (the 6 numbers) from top-numbers array.
//


//timer starts for 30 secs when go-button is pressed
//to make image work use 30 images of clock in different positions and run in sequence
//or use video ---- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2dhD9zR6hk
//
//after 30secs is up dim clock image and display "times up".



//user presses solution button to give up
//stop clock video when solution displays on the left side of page.

//display solution on the left side of page
//this will be converting calulation into strings of text.
//use index values used by the computer to solve and return these in each step of calulation.

//user presses reset to clear everything on page
